This project implements the basic functionality of the popular game "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire". The game consists of 12 questions, each with 4 possible answers, where only one answer is correct. The player progresses through the questions, earning money for each correct answer. If the answer is incorrect, the game ends, and the player is directed to the final screen, displaying their overall result. The layout design is provided and is fully adaptive to different screen sizes.

### Technologies Used:
The project employs modern web development technologies such as React for building dynamic user interfaces, HTML for structuring web elements, and SCSS with BEM methodology for advanced styling features. It also utilizes Redux for efficient state management, React Router for navigation within the application, and TypeScript for enhanced code quality and type safety.
